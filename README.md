Fall Detection System Using Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect and Blynk IoT

Overview
This project implements a fall detection system using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Blynk IoT platform. The system monitors real-time acceleration data to detect falls and sends alerts via Blynk. Additionally, an SOS button allows manual alerts in case of emergencies.

Features
  •	Fall Detection: Uses variance of net acceleration to identify falls.
  •	SOS Alert: A physical button to trigger emergency alerts.
  •	Blynk Integration: Sends real-time data and notifications to the Blynk dashboard.
  •	Data Visualization: Displays variance trends on the Blynk dashboard.
  •	Customizable Threshold: Easily adjust the variance threshold for fall detection.

How It Works
1.	Initialization: Sets up the IMU sensor, Wi-Fi connection, and Blynk integration.
2.	Data Collection: Continuously reads acceleration values from the IMU.
3.	Fall Detection: Calculates the variance of acceleration data over a set of samples and compares it against a threshold.
4.	Alerts: If a fall is detected, sends a "Fall Detected!" alert to Blynk or If the SOS button is pressed, sends an emergency alert to Blynk.
5.	Dashboard Visualization: Displays variance data, fall status, and SOS state on the Blynk dashboard.
